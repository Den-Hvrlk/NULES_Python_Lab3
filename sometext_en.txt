Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer executes to solve specific problems. A programming language is a means of communication between a programmer and a computer that allows you to write machine-readable code. There are various programming languages ​​such as Python, Java, C#, each of which has its own advantages and applications.
One of the key elements of programming are algorithms — a clear sequence of actions that leads to the desired result. The ability to effectively create and optimize algorithms is the foundation of successful software development. In addition, it is important to understand data structures because they help organize and store information for further processing.
